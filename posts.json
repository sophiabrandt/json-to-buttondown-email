This helps distinguish your idea.\n\nUse verbal punctuation.  \nPeople occasionally fog out. Provide landmarks for them to get back on track.\n\nAsk a question.  \nYou can wait for 7 seconds for an answer. Choose your question carefully. Not too obvious, not too hard.\n\n## Time and Place\n\nAround 11am: people are awake, before the meal.\n\nPlace: well-lit, audience should not fall asleep.\n\nCase the place before.\n\n## Tools\n\nSlides: for exposing knowledge\n\nAlways: too many slides, too many words.\n\nBlackboard & chalk: for informing, teaching, lecturing.\n\nBoard:\n\n- has a graphic quality\n- speed: The speed in which you write down things corresponds to the speed on which the audience can grasp your ideas\n- target: speaker has something to do with their hands\n\n**Props** are important for mirror neurons: audience is more engaged because they feel like writing on the board or using the prop.\n\n### How to Improve Slides\n\n- do not read\n- be in the image\n- keep images simple\n- eliminate clutter\n\nForce the audience to listen to you instead of reading the slides.\n\nAvoid the laser pointer crime: you need to point to the slides and lose contact to the audience.\n\n## How to Inspire\n\nExhibit passion.\n\n## How to Teach People How to Think\n\nProvide people with\n\n- the stories they need to know\n- questions they need to ask about those stories\n- mechanisms for analyzing\n- ways of putting stories together\n- ways of evaluating how reliable a story is\n\n## How to Persuade\n\n### Job Talks\n\nYou have 5 minutes to show that\n* you have vision\n* done something\n\nVision relates to a problem that somebody cares about. You offer something new in your approach.\n\nList the steps to solve the problem you presented - you don't have to have completed all steps.\n\nEnumerate your contributions to establish that you've done something.\n\n### Get Recognition\n\nWhy should you care?  \nYou never get used to being ignored.\n\nHow?\n\nYou need a\n* symbol for your work\n* slogan\n* surprise\n* salient idea\n* story\n\n## How to Stop\n\n### Final Slide\n\nDon'ts:\n\n* thank collaborators (put it on the first slide)\n* questions?\n* more details see link\n* \"the end\"\n* conclusions\n\nInstead:\n\nContributions\n\n### Final Words\n\n\"Thank you\" is a weak move.\n\nYou can tell a joke.\n\nSalute the audience.\n\n[youtube]: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY\n\n\n<hr />\n## [Use Ionic Angular With pnpm](https://www.rockyourcode.com/use-ionic-angular-with-pnpm/)\n\nPublished on: 2022-06-27\n\ntags: Angular, Ionic\n\n\nIonic is an \"open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies\".\n\nI use it to explore building native apps for iOs and Android using Angular.\n\nIonic has a CLI (command line interface) to scaffold a project.\n\nIf you want to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), run the following command in your terminal to create a new project:\n\n```bash\npnpm --package=@ionic/cli dlx ionic start \\\n  MyFirstApp \\\n  blank \\\n  --type angular\n```\n\n`pnpm dlx` fetches packages from the registry [without installing them as a dependency](https://pnpm.io/next/cli/dlx). It is the equivalent to `npx`.\n\nThe CLI will use `pnpm` to install packages, too.\n\nIf you encounter problems later, you can also manually set the package manager in your project:\n\n```bash\npnpm exec ionic config set -g npmClient pnpm\n```\n\nThe above command assumes that the ionic CLI is a dev dependency inside `package.json`.\n\n\n<hr />\n## [Notes on ‚ÄúKeeping Your Career Current‚Äù](https://www.rockyourcode.com/notes-on-keeping-your-career-current/)\n\nPublished on: 2022-04-26\n\ntags: Lab, Notes\n\n\nHere is some advice from [Joe Eames](https://twitter.com/josepheames) from the [Angular Plus Show, Episode 075: Keeping Your Career Current][aplus]:\n\n- conferences & talks show you the lay of the land, they don't teach you how to do things, only what is possible\n- **retention**: you forget a lot, so passively watching a video is almost a waste of time\n- make it interactive: take notes - you can even delete them later, but engaging with the material will increase your retention rate\n- pause, try things out (e.g., use [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/))\n- better than following along: come up with an idea and do that (don't wait until the end of the video/course); this is like **assigning yourself homework**\n- consistency matters: be realistic, a lot of things take time\n- heuristics: are you able to use this at your job? If not, do you have a side project where you can use it? If neither is true, and you're not trying to switch your job, think about if it's worth learning\n\n## Links\n* [Angular Plus Show E075][aplus]\n* [Notes on ‚ÄúHow to Learn Anything 5x Faster (Joe Eames)‚Äù](https://www.rockyourcode.com/notes-on-how-to-learn-anything-5x-faster/)\n\n[aplus]: https://podtail.com/podcast/the-angular-show/e075-keeping-your-career-current/\n\n\n<hr />\n## [Testcontainers With Colima](https://www.rockyourcode.com/testcontainers-with-colima/)\n\nPublished on: 2022-04-09\n\ntags: Java, Kotlin, Testing\n\n\n**[Testcontainers][testcontainers]** is a Java library to support testing database operations with Docker containers.\n\nThe library needs a working Docker context to spin up the containers.\n\nIf you use [Colima/Lima][colima] as a [Docker replacement][replacedocker], you might come across the following error:\n\n```bash\nCould not find a valid Docker environment. Please see logs and check configuration\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not find a valid Docker environment. Please see logs and check configuration\n\tat org.testcontainers.dockerclient.DockerClientProviderStrategy.lambda$getFirstValidStrategy$4(DockerClientProviderStrategy.java)\n```\n\nYou can override the [docker host detection][customize] by providing the following environment variables (in your Bash/Zsh shell):\n\n```bash\nexport TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock\nexport DOCKER_HOST=\"unix://${HOME}/.colima/docker.sock\"\n```\n\nFor [Fish](https://fishshell.com/):\n\n```fish\nset -x TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE /var/run/docker.sock\nset -x DOCKER_HOST unix://{$HOME}/.colima/docker.sock\n```\n\nI had to restart IntelliJ to make sure that the program picks up the changed environment.\n\n\n## Links:\n\n- [How to configure Testcontainers to work with Colima as container runtime? #5034][gh]\n- [Testcontainers][testcontainers]\n\n[gh]: https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5034#issuecomment-1036433226\n[customize]: https://www.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/\n[colima]: https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/\n[replacedocker]: https://www.rockyourcode.com/docker-desktop-alternatives-for-macos/\n[testcontainers]: https://www.testcontainers.org/\n\n\n<hr />\n\nThank you for reading my blog.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:hi@rockyourcode.com\") or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hisophiabrandt)!\n"}
