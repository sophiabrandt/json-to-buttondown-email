Thanks for subscribing.\n\n\nHere are the articles from last week:\n\n## [Use Ionic Angular With pnpm](https://www.rockyourcode.com/use-ionic-angular-with-pnpm/)\n\nPublished on: 2022-06-27\n\ntags: Angular, Ionic\n\n\nIonic is an \"open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies\".\n\nI use it to explore building native apps for iOs and Android using Angular.\n\nIonic has a CLI (command line interface) to scaffold a project.\n\nIf you want to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), run the following command in your terminal to create a new project:\n\n```bash\npnpm --package=@ionic/cli dlx ionic start \\\n  MyFirstApp \\\n  blank \\\n  --type angular\n```\n\n`pnpm dlx` fetches packages from the registry [without installing them as a dependency](https://pnpm.io/next/cli/dlx). It is the equivalent to `npx`.\n\nThe CLI will use `pnpm` to install packages, too.\n\nIf you encounter problems later, you can also manually set the package manager in your project:\n\n```bash\npnpm exec ionic config set -g npmClient pnpm\n```\n\nThe above command assumes that the ionic CLI is a dev dependency inside `package.json`.\n\n\n<hr />\n## [Notes on ‚ÄúKeeping Your Career Current‚Äù](https://www.rockyourcode.com/notes-on-keeping-your-career-current/)\n\nPublished on: 2022-04-26\n\ntags: Lab, Notes\n\n\nHere is some advice from [Joe Eames](https://twitter.com/josepheames) from the [Angular Plus Show, Episode 075: Keeping Your Career Current][aplus]:\n\n- conferences & talks show you the lay of the land, they don't teach you how to do things, only what is possible\n- **retention**: you forget a lot, so passively watching a video is almost a waste of time\n- make it interactive: take notes - you can even delete them later, but engaging with the material will increase your retention rate\n- pause, try things out (e.g., use [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/))\n- better than following along: come up with an idea and do that (don't wait until the end of the video/course); this is like **assigning yourself homework**\n- consistency matters: be realistic, a lot of things take time\n- heuristics: are you able to use this at your job? If not, do you have a side project where you can use it? If neither is true, and you're not trying to switch your job, think about if it's worth learning\n\n## Links\n* [Angular Plus Show E075][aplus]\n* [Notes on ‚ÄúHow to Learn Anything 5x Faster (Joe Eames)‚Äù](https://www.rockyourcode.com/notes-on-how-to-learn-anything-5x-faster/)\n\n[aplus]: https://podtail.com/podcast/the-angular-show/e075-keeping-your-career-current/\n\n\n<hr />\n## [Testcontainers With Colima](https://www.rockyourcode.com/testcontainers-with-colima/)\n\nPublished on: 2022-04-09\n\ntags: Java, Kotlin, Testing\n\n\n**[Testcontainers][testcontainers]** is a Java library to support testing database operations with Docker containers.\n\nThe library needs a working Docker context to spin up the containers.\n\nIf you use [Colima/Lima][colima] as a [Docker replacement][replacedocker], you might come across the following error:\n\n```bash\nCould not find a valid Docker environment. Please see logs and check configuration\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not find a valid Docker environment. Please see logs and check configuration\n\tat org.testcontainers.dockerclient.DockerClientProviderStrategy.lambda$getFirstValidStrategy$4(DockerClientProviderStrategy.java)\n```\n\nYou can override the [docker host detection][customize] by providing the following environment variables (in your Bash/Zsh shell):\n\n```bash\nexport TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock\nexport DOCKER_HOST=\"unix://${HOME}/.colima/docker.sock\"\n```\n\nFor [Fish](https://fishshell.com/):\n\n```fish\nset -x TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE /var/run/docker.sock\nset -x DOCKER_HOST unix://{$HOME}/.colima/docker.sock\n```\n\nI had to restart IntelliJ to make sure that the program picks up the changed environment.\n\n\n## Links:\n\n- [How to configure Testcontainers to work with Colima as container runtime? #5034][gh]\n- [Testcontainers][testcontainers]\n\n[gh]: https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5034#issuecomment-1036433226\n[customize]: https://www.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/\n[colima]: https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/\n[replacedocker]: https://www.rockyourcode.com/docker-desktop-alternatives-for-macos/\n[testcontainers]: https://www.testcontainers.org/\n\n\n<hr />\n## [Notes on ‚ÄúAvoid These Common Mistakes Junior Developers Make‚Äù](https://www.rockyourcode.com/notes-on-avoid-these-common-mistakes-junior-developers-make/)\n\nPublished on: 2022-03-06\n\ntags: Notes, Lab\n\n\nHere are some notes on [Dave Farley's video on Youtube][you].\n\n[![Avoid These Common Mistakes Junior Developers Make!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5g3dK2DgW-k/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5g3dK2DgW-k \"Avoid These Common Mistakes Junior Developers Make!\")\n\n1. Software Developers Is All About Coding\n\nSoftware development is about solving problems, not about code.\n\n2. If Only the Business Would Get the Requirements Right\n\nThis sentences completely misses the point. It assumes that developers are paid to code, and that someone else will tell them what to do.\n\nNobody really knows what users want. Everyone is guessing. The job of developers is to build systems in a world of uncertainty.\n\nThe goal is to protect against bad guesses and to incrementally evolve solutions to problems, so that we have freedom to make mistakes.\n\n3. Speed Is All That Matters\n\nTake the time to think. Once the problem is clear, the coding is easy.\n\nOptimize for learning, not for feature production\n\n4. My Job Is to Code, Not to Understand the Problem Domain\n\nYou don't have to be a domain expert, but you need to have a surface level understanding. Try to see the real problem in the real world.\n\n5. I Can't Ask for Help. It Shows That I Don't Know Enough.\n\nSmart people ask questions. Get comfortable with uncertainty.\n\nGive yourself the freedom to ask twice. If you have to ask a third time, go to the person answering and explain that you didn't understand it and ask for help.\n\n6. Software Architecture Is for the Experts\n\nYou should be able to explain how the system works. Could you explain it to your (non-technical) friend?\n\nWhat are the organizing principles that really matter?  \nWhat ideas help you to decide where to place behavior in your system?\n\n7. Testing Is Someone Else's Job!\n\nDevelopers should write tests. Developers are responsible for building the system, sothey should be able to test if it works.\n\n8. I Would Like to Do a Better Job, but My Boss Won't Let Me!\n\nThis could be a cultural problem. But at some point, we must take responsibility for our own work.\n\nFocus on the stuff that you can control, and take ownership of it.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Avoid These Common Mistakes Junior Developers Make!][you]\n\n[you]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3dK2DgW-k\n\n\n<hr />\n\nThank you for reading my blog.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:hi@rockyourcode.com\") or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hisophiabrandt)!\n"}
