No more than 100 lines per class\n2. No more than 5 lines per method\n3. No more than 4 parameters per method\n4. No more than 1 [instance variable per view](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33371300/what-is-ivar-in-rails-controller)\n5. No more than 2 class names per controller/action (a Rails-specific rule)\n\nWhy?\n\n- bias towards small objects (POROs = plain old Ruby objects)\n- bias away from dependencies\n- the rules are a means to an end: consistent goals\n- _design choice_ of small objects\n- objects vs. procedures\n- the _entire_ applications is harder to understand, but you don't need to understand the whole app â€” you only need to understand the part you want to change\n- following the rules might be in your self-interest\n\n## Other benefits of rules\n\n- signal others\n- bias to collaboration\n- the _belief_ in some rules and the willingness and self-discipline to follow them\n- you can break the rules only under the supervision of trustworthy humans\n\n## Links\n\n- [Baruco 2013: Rules, by Sandi Metz][talk]\n  [![Baruco 2013: Rules, by Sandi Metz](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/npOGOmkxuio/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=npOGOmkxuio 'Baruco 2013: Rules, by Sandi Metz')\n\n[talk]: https://youtube.com/watch?v=npOGOmkxuio\n\n\n<hr />\nThank you for reading my blog posts.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:hi@rockyourcode.com\") or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hisophiabrandt)!\n"}
